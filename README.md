To speed up the work:

1. First analyze the pattern, e.g most of the sections have same design of title and description or buttons, so try to make separate component of it, to use it atdifferent places.

2. First write the mobile responsive code and then go for Desktop application.

3. If your using flex then use flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis properties, it will make work faster and easier for responsive code.

4. Common use color used in website, write it in tsconfig.

5. For svg images use tailwind width and height to handle svg images on every screen size.
